    <h1> Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California, United States. Tesla designs and manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. In 2020, Tesla had the most sales of battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the battery-electric (purely electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) installed in 2020.

        Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million investment, X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company and its chairman. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began production of its first car model, the Roadster, in 2009. This was followed by the Tesla Model S sedan in 2012, the Tesla Model X SUV in 2015, the Tesla Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Tesla Model Y crossover in 2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[6] Tesla's global vehicle sales were 499,550 units in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year.
        
        Tesla has been the subject of several lawsuits and controversies arising from statements and acts of CEO Elon Musk and from allegations of creative accounting, whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations, and unresolved and dangerous technical problems with their products. In September 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) ordered Tesla to submit data pertaining to all sold US vehicles equipped with Autopilot.</h1>

       The Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback produced by Tesla, Inc. It was introduced on June 22, 2012.[12] It received a major refresh in June 2021. Tesla positions the Model S as its flagship.
       
       In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013[13][14][15][16] and in Denmark in December 2015.[17] Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018.[18][19][20][21] The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3.[22][23][24]
       
       In an early review of the Model S, Consumer Reports declared, "This car performs better than anything we've ever tested before. Let me repeat that: Not just the best electric car, but the best car. It does just about everything really, really well."[25] In their Owner Satisfaction survey owners have consistently rated Teslas at, or near, the top rankings.[26] In 2019, Motor Trend named the 2013 Tesla Model S the ultimate "Car of the Year" over the magazine's entire 70-year history.[27]

    <h1>Tesla model 3</h1>


    <img src="tes3.PNG"height="240" width="400">
    
    <article>

        The Model 3 is an electric fastback mid-size four-door sedan developed by Tesla.
         The Model 3 Standard Range Plus version delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of
          262 miles (422 km) and the Long Range versions deliver 353 miles (568 km).
           According to Tesla, the Model 3 carries full self-driving hardware,
            with periodic software updates adding functionality.

        Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017,
         with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7, 2017.
          The official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars took place on July 28.
        
        The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than some other models by Tesla.
         Since early 2020, the Model 3 is the world's best-selling electric car in history,
          and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to pass the 1 million global sales milestone.
          The Model 3 has been the world's top selling plug-in electric car (PEV) for three years running,
           from 2018 to 2020. It has also been the best-selling PEV in the United States for three
            consecutive years, 2018 to 2020, the top selling PEV in Europe in 2019,
             and the best-selling PEV in China in 2020.

    <h1>Tesla model x</h1>

<img src="tesx.PNG"height="240" width="400">

<article>

    The Tesla Model X is a mid-size all-electric luxury crossover made by Tesla, Inc.
     The vehicle is notable in that it uses falcon-wing doors for passenger access.

    The Model X was developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S. 
    The Model X has an EPA size class as an SUV, and shares ~30% of its content with the Model S,
     half of the originally planned ~60%, and weighs about 10 percent more.
      Both the Model X and Model S are being produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, 
      California. The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne, California on February 9,
       2012.[11][12] First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015.
        After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's
         best-selling plug-in cars.
    
    As of April 12, 2021, the Model X is only available as the Long Range with an estimated EPA range
     of 360.4 miles (580.0 km) and the Plaid model with an estimated EPA range of 339.9 miles (547.0 km).
      Both come with Tesla's Autopilot driver assistance system.

<h1>Tesla model y</h1>

<article>

    The Tesla Model Y is an electric compact crossover utility vehicle (CUV) by Tesla, Inc.
     Tesla unveiled it in March 2019,started production at its Fremont plant in January 2020, 
     and started deliveries on March 13, 2020.

    It is the second vehicle based on the Model 3 sedan platform.
     The Model Y shares an estimated 75% of its parts with the Tesla Model 3,
      which includes a similar interior design and electric powertrain.
       Model Y offers optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity.
        The Model Y fills a smaller and less expensive segment than the full-sized Tesla Model X.
    
    There were four planned powertrain configurations for the Model Y: Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD),
     Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, Long Range with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD),
      and Performance (with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive). The Long Range AWD model and the Performance
       model are currently being delivered. The Standard Range RWD configuration was initially canceled 
       in July 2020, due to the range (230 miles EPA) being unacceptably low to Musk,
        but was orderable as of January 2021 (with 244 miles of EPA range).
        By February 7, 2021, the Long Range RWD appears to have been cancelled.

<h1>Tesla Cybertruck</h1>

<video src="tesc.mp4" controls height="270" width="800" ></video>

<article>

    The Tesla Cybertruck is an all-electric, battery-powered, light-duty truck announced by Tesla, Inc.
     Three models have been announced, with EPA range estimates of 400–800 kilometers (250–500 mi)
      and an estimated 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 2.9–6.5 seconds, depending on the model.

The stated goal of Tesla in developing the Cybertruck is to provide a sustainable energy substitute for 
the roughly 6,500 fossil-fuel-powered trucks sold per day in the United States.

The base price of the rear-wheel drive (RWD) model of the vehicle was announced to be US$39,900,
 with all-wheel drive (AWD) models starting at US$49,900. Production of the dual-motor AWD and tri-motor
  AWD Cybertruck production was slated to begin in late 2021, with the RWD model release date in late 2022,
   but production was pushed back to 2022.
